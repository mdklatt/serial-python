record-oriented data in various formats. The core library is contained in the
`serial.core` package. Library extensions are contained in their own packages.

* Python 2.6 - 2.7
* [unittest2][4] (optional; required to run test suite with Python 2.6)

Python 2.6 requirements can be installed using `pip`:

    pip install -r requirements-py26.txt


Installation
------------
Place the [serial][5] directory in the Python [module search path][6]. The
[setup script][7] can be used to install the library in the desired location,
typically the system or user-specific `site-packages` directory.

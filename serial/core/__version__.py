""" The current version of the serial.core package.

This package uses the Semantic Versioning scheme:
    <http://semver.org/>
    
Major versions introduce significant changes to the API, and backwards 
compatibility is not guaranteed. Minor versions are for new features and other
backwards-compatible changes to the API. Patch versions are for bug fixes and
internal code changes that do not affect the API.

Version 0.x should be considered a development version with an unstable API,
and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed for minor versions.
